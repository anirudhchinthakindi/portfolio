            description: 'Over 15.5 hours across two sessions (December 18 and 26, 2025), I shadowed Dr. Robert A Hymes, an orthopedic surgeon, at Inova Orthopedics: first in clinic (not pictured), then in the OR. The clinic day showed me how orthopedic surgeons make treatment decisions based on quality of life rather than just fixing every injury, which was, to say, a different perspective than I expected. Then on the OR day, I followed both Dr. Robert A Hymes and Dr. Yong Seon Lee (not pictured), an orthopedic surgery resident, through three cases at Inova Fairfax Hospital. Started with morning rounds where residents presented cases to attendings, then scrubbed in to observe a right knee washout, hardware removal from a pelvis (plates and screws from a car accident) and a wrist fracture repair. It was super interesting to see the OR team dynamic (surgeons, residents, nurses, anesthesia) all working together while Dr. Hymes taught throughout the procedures. As an EMT, it was especially cool to see the surgical side of injuries I have helped patients for. As a sidenote: both Dr. Yong and Dr. Hymes confirmed the "Ortho Bro" stereotype is real, which honestly makes the field seem even more appealing. I’m heavily considering ortho now, so overall, a great experience.',

I observed patient consultations ranging from complex diagnostic cases to longitudinal care of Parkinson's Disease patients, learning how neurologists balance diagnostic reasoning with building meaningful patient relationships. Dr. Dalrymple's approach to patient care (taking time to coordinate with families, explaining treatment rationale, and emphasizing lifestyle interventions like aerobic exercise alongside medical management) strengthened my own interest in specialties that have both intellectual challenges and the opportunity for longitudinal care. This experience made me appreciate neurology a bit more, and see it in its unique combo of clinical mystery-solving and long-term patient partnership.",
